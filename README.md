## An Opinionated COLEMAK-DHm for Kyria 2.1 on a mac

This is my COLEMAK keyboard layout for my Kyria 2.1 for Apple mac. The layout is the DHm variant, now known as just DH. 

Inspiration for the symbols came from another github repo, but there have been some significant modifications since then, and I cant remember the URL now anyway.

It uses [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup), in my case on two [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/)'s

It follows the layout found here:

Which looks like this:
